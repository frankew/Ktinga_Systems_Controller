Klingon Battle Cruiser model lights controller for Arduino. 

There are seven circuits. Four are connected to "dumb" LEDs:

2. Navigation Beacons
3. Floodlights
4. Reactor Lights

Three are connected to WS2812B NeoPixels:

1. Forward Torpedo
2. Reactor Intake
3. Thruster Exhaust

The dumb LED circuits run on 12v, the NeoPixels need 5v.
